# cowsay-php
The [Cowsay program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay) is eponymous amongst programmers.  I was planning on flexing some PHP learning skills and making one in PHP.  

THis program might exist on a server later this month but I haven't decided that yet.  All of the development will be done locally.  Probably going to add some cool non cow animals as well. Dragons?
